rTorrent is a text-based ncurses BitTorrent client written in C++, based on the libTorrent libraries for Unix, whose author's goal is "a focus on high performance and good code".

rTorrent is for advanced users, to use rTorrent log in to your NAS through SSH and execute: `rtorrent-attach`

You can then interact with rtorrent, to detach the process you can use the `Ctrl+T` key-combination.

The configuration files are located in `/usr/local/AppCentral/rtorrent/config`. To restart rtorrent you execute `/usr/local/AppCentral/rtorrent/CONTROL/start-stop.sh restart`.

A sample `rtorrent.rc` is provided in the config directory with a few pre-made choices (feel free to change them).
